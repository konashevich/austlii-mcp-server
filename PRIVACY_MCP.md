# Olexi MCP Server — Privacy Policy

Effective: 14 August 2025

- The Olexi MCP Server does not intentionally collect or store personal data from end users.
- On Google Cloud Run, connection metadata (e.g., IP address, timestamps) may be captured in operational logs for security, rate limiting, and troubleshooting.
- These logs are not transferred, sold, or used for commercial purposes. Retention and access are governed by Google Cloud logging settings. We aim to minimise retention consistent with operational needs.
- Third‑party services: the MCP server may query external services (e.g., AustLII at austlii.edu.au). Any AI agent or host you pair with this MCP server is under your control. We are not responsible for what third parties collect or how they process data. Their policies apply.
- Contact: open an issue in the repository with questions about this policy.
