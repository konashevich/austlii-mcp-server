The ACCC also pursued accessorial liability against Mr Wills (controller of a related marketing firm).\n- Issue: Whether the provider’s “system of conduct” was unconscionable under ACL s 21 without proving intent for harm to occur, and what knowledge is needed to be “knowingly concerned” in the contravention.\n- Holding:\n  - Unconscionable system of conduct affirmed: ACL s 21 proscription is a normative standard assessed “in all the circumstances”; intention for the risk to materialise is not required where the increased risk was reasonably foreseeable (s 21(3)(a)).\n  - s 22 ACL factors: They are a non‑exhaustive framework to guide the evaluative judgment, not a checklist that must be mechanically ticked; judges must address applicable factors and the totality of circumstances.\n  - Systemic unconscionability (s 21(4)(b)): The statute can condemn systems or patterns even without pinpointing harm to a specific individual.\n  - Accessorial liability: A person need not know conduct is “unconscionable” in law; it suffices they know the essential facts comprising the contravention and participate in it.\n- Outcome: Provider’s appeal failed; the Full Court’s error was only in trimming the timeframe of Wills’ accessorial liability—HCA restored the primary judge’s earlier start date.\n- Key principles:\n  - Risk/foreseeability can ground statutory unconscionability; no requirement of intent that harm eventuate.\n  - The ACL’s statutory concept goes beyond equity; special disadvantage/exploitation isn’t required for s 21 (contrast with s 20).\n  - Knowledge for accessorial liability = essential facts, not legal characterisation.\n  - Some judges discuss “moral obloquy”; the Court overall applies a statute‑anchored, value‑informed normative standard.\n\n### Stubbings v Jams 2 Pty Ltd [2022] HCA 6 (16 Mar 2022)\nLink: https://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/cth/HCA/2022/6.html\n\n- Facts: “Pure asset‑based” loans were arranged via a solicitor‑run system that deliberately avoided inquiring into the guarantor’s (Mr Stubbings’) income/means; he was unemployed with poor financial literacy and mortgaged three properties; “independent” advice certificates were used to “immunise” the arrangers.\n- Issue: Whether enforcing the loans and guarantees was unconscionable (equity and, alternatively, under ASIC Act s 12CB/ACL s 21) given the borrower’s vulnerability and the system’s wilful blindness.\n- Holding:\n  - Equity: Unconscientious exploitation established—Mr Stubbings was at a special disadvantage; the solicitor/lenders knew or ought to have known and exploited it. Certificates did not cure the wilful blindness and were part of the system enabling exploitation.\n  - Statutory (analysis by Gordon/Edelman JJ): Statutory unconscionability is broader than equity and can apply to systems even without identifying a particular disadvantaged individual; the s 12CC factors (mirrored in ACL s 22) guide the evaluative standard.\n- Outcome: Relief granted; enforcement restrained/set aside.\n- Key principles:\n  - Equity still requires special disadvantage + unconscientious taking advantage; knowledge can be actual or “ought to have known” (incl. wilful blindness).\n  - A system designed to avoid learning confounding facts can itself be unconscionable.\n  - “Independent advice” certificates won’t shield conduct where the system manufactures ignorance and the advice is not truly independent.\n\n## Context anchor (pre‑2022 but influential)\n- ASIC v Kobelt [2019] HCA 18: Divided court; important statutory guidance that the standard is a serious, value‑laden condemnation of conduct outside acceptable norms, informed by non‑exhaustive factors, and not confined to equity’s special‑disadvantage paradigm. Link: https://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/cth/HCA/2019/18.html\n\n## Practical takeaways\n- Statutory vs equity:\n  - Equity (Amadio line): needs special disadvantage + exploitation + (constructive) knowledge.\n  - ACL s 21/ASIC s 12CB: broader, may capture systemic “sharp practice,” foreseeable risk creation, and post‑contract conduct; apply s 22/s 12CC factors as a principled framework.\n- Accessorial liability: Knowing the essential facts that make the conduct unconscionable suffices; no need to appreciate the legal label.\n- Systems cases: Removing safeguards or designing “wilful blindness” processes can be unconscionable even without intent that harm eventuate.\n\n## Browse more\n- HCA search (2022–2025): https://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/sinosrch.cgi?query=unconscionab%2A+OR+%22unconscionable+conduct%22+date%282022-2025%29&method=boolean&meta=%2Fau&mask_path=au%2Fcases%2Fcth%2FHCA\n\nRequirements coverage: \n- Recent HCA cases identified (2022, 2024) — Done\n- Summaries with facts/issues/holdings/principles — Done\n- Authoritative links and browse link — Done\n- Doctrinal takeaways contrasting equity/statute — Done\n\nIf you want, I can turn these into one‑page case notes or add pinpoint references for teaching materials.",

ONLY stop if solved or genuinely blocked.\nTake action when possible; the user expects you to do useful work without unnecessary questions.\nAfter any parallel, read-only context gathering, give a concise progress update and what's next.\nAvoid repetition across turns: don't restate unchanged plans or sections (like the todo list) verbatim; provide delta updates or only the parts that changed.\nTool batches: You MUST preface each batch with a one-sentence why/what/outcome preamble.\nProgress cadence: After 3 to 5 tool calls, or when you create/edit > ~3 files in a burst, pause and post a compact checkpoint.\nRequirements coverage: Read the user's ask in full, extract each requirement into checklist items, and keep them visible. Do not omit a requirement. If something cannot be done with available tools, note why briefly and propose a viable alternative.\nWhen using the insert_edit_into_file tool, avoid repeating existing code, instead use a line comment with \\`...existing code...\\` to represent regions of unchanged code.\nSkip filler acknowledgements like “Sounds good” or “Okay, I will…”. Open with a purposeful one-liner about what you're doing next.\nWhen sharing setup or run steps, present terminal commands in fenced code blocks with the correct language tag. Keep commands copyable and on separate lines.\nAvoid definitive claims about the build or runtime setup unless verified from the provided context (or quick tool checks). If uncertain, state what's known from attachments and proceed with minimal steps you can adapt later.\nWhen you create or edit runnable code, run a test yourself to confirm it works; then share optional fenced commands for more advanced runs.\nDo not state your identity or model name unless the user explicitly asks you to. \nFor non-trivial code generation, produce a complete, runnable solution: necessary source files, a tiny runner or test/benchmark harness, a minimal `README.md`, and updated dependency manifests (e.g., `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`). Offer quick \"try it\" commands and optional platform-specific speed-ups when relevant.\nYour goal is to act like a pair programmer: be friendly and helpful. If you can do more, do more. Be proactive with your solutions, think about what the user needs and what they want, and implement it proactively.\n<importantReminders>\nALWAYS start your response with a brief task receipt and a concise high-level plan for how you will proceed.\nBreak down the request into clear, actionable steps and present them as a checklist at the beginning of your response before proceeding with implementation. This helps maintain visibility and ensures all requirements are addressed systematically.\nEvery so often, explain the notable action you are about to take next, especially before multi-step or impactful tool calls.\n\n</importantReminders>\n\n</reminderInstructions>\n<userRequest>\nFind recent HCA cases on unconscionable conduct and summarise.\n</userRequest>\n"

As to systems liability, one of the traditional means of holding a corporation\nliable has been based on the attribution to the corporation of the actions of the\nnatural persons that are its agents.[197] But the heuristic of the \"actions\" and \"intentions\" of a corporation is not\nconfined to the attributed actions of natural persons. A corporation might also be\ntreated as having acted or as having an intention based upon its systems, that\nis, its policies, procedures or patterns of conduct.\n200. The novelty of corporate systems liability is that a corporation can be treated\nas having acted, and as having intentions, without those actions having been\ntaken, or those intentions held, by any individual natural person.

The travel to Manchester or the setting fire\nto the house are chosen as means to the end of escaping pursuit or injuring the\nenemy, even if those means are not emotionally desired.\n...",

An accessory is a person to whom the liability of a principal for a crime or\ncivil wrong is attributed. The accessory did not commit the crime or other wrong\nbut will have attributed to them the liability of the person who did. Since the\nfocus is upon attribution of liability for a wrong found to have been committed by\nanother, it has rightly been said that \"[t]he very basis of secondary liability\nis different from that of a principal\".[241]\n258. As will be explained below, the basis for attribution to the accessory of\nliability for an offence or contravention is that the accessory must have intended to\nbe involved with the essence of the primary offence or contravention.

His\nHonour acknowledged that an advantage of Mr Kobelt's book-up system was that it\nprovided a relatively simple means by which Anangu persons could obtain credit\nthat would not otherwise be available to them[18].\n29. Mr Kobelt knew most of his Anangu customers and he was aware of their financial\ncircumstances. He did not make inquiries about his Anangu customers' capacity to\nrepay the balance of the purchase price of a second-hand car or other consumer\ngood before entering into book-up credit arrangements with the customer.

The legal error that is said to underlie ASIC's first ground is the Full Court's\nasserted failure to distinguish the principles of undue influence from those of\nunconscionability under the general law. The argument directs attention to\ntheir differing focus: undue influence being concerned with the quality of the\nconsent of the weaker party and unconscionability being concerned with the conduct of\nthe stronger party in taking advantage of the vulnerability of the weaker\nparty. ASIC submits that, while the exertion of undue influence bears on the\ndetermination of unconscionability, the absence of undue influence is entirely neutral\nand the Full Court was wrong to take it into account.\n57.

More importantly, Anangu customers could, and on occasion did, sever their\nrelationship with Mr Kobelt by such simple expedients as not returning their debit\ncards after travelling, cancelling their debit cards, or redirecting their\nperiodic payments into other accounts[99].\n106.

It is sometimes said that unconscionable conduct entails \"moral obloquy\" or a\n\"high level of moral obloquy\"[162]. So to describe unconscionable conduct, however, reveals little of the\nrequisite character of unconscionability. Such descriptors are better seen as emphatic\nexpressions of conclusion rather than expressions of applicable standards.\n153. The doctrine of unconscionability was recently criticised by the Court of Appeal\nof Singapore for its vagueness and generality[163]. The Court applied a distinction between \"broad\" and \"narrow\" unconscionability\nin an effort to address this issue[164]. The utility of such distinctions, however, is questionable. Certainly, in any\ngiven case, a conclusion as to what is, or is not, against conscience may be\ncontestable: so much is inevitable given that the standard is based on a broad\n...",

Money is spent as it becomes available, without\nconsideration of the medium- to long-term consequences of such expenditure. A\nsignificant number of Mr Kobelt's book-up customers were affected in this way.\n...",

In his Honour's view, the primary\njudge's analysis of these various alternatives tended to ignore evidence that\nsuggested that the Anangu may have preferred Mr Kobelt's book-up system to the\nalternatives because it involved the personalisation of the financial transaction.
