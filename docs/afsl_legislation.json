Attempted scoped search links, then pivoted to direct deep-linking each relevant section page due to unstable search endpoints.\n- Debugging/adjustment: A search endpoint returned “Gone” (deprecated). Strategy changed to verifying each target section with direct URLs and confirming headings/subsections match expectations.\n- Current state: A growing, verified pack of direct legislation links for AFSL core provisions has been assembled. Early verified Corporations Act sections: s 911A, s 912A, s 913A, s 913B, s 914A, s 915B; and s 763A, s 766A. Most recent wave verified additional Part 7.6 and Part 7.1 provisions (s 915A, s 916A, s 916B, s 917B, s 920A, s 922A, s 926A, s 766B, s 766C). Preparing the final curated legislation-only link pack.\n\n[Intent Mapping: List each explicit user request with message context]\n- “Australian Financial Services Licence, find legislation, no caselaw.”\n  - Provide legislation-only sources that govern AFSL.\n  - Exclude case law and commentary.\n  - Deliver working direct links to relevant Act sections and Regulations.\n\n[Technical Inventory: Catalog all technologies, patterns, and decisions mentioned]\n- Sources/databases: AustLII Commonwealth Consolidated Acts and Regulations:\n  - Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), Corporations Regulations 2001 (Cth).\n  - ASIC Act 2001 (Cth), ASIC Regulations 2001 (Cth).\n- Approach:\n  - Replace fragile search endpoints with verified direct section URLs.\n  - Prioritize Corporations Act Part 7.6 + Part 7.1 definitions; then Corporations Regulations; then ASIC Act provisions.\n  - Verify each page loads and heading/subsections match intended content.\n- Constraints: Legislation-only; no case law.\n\n[Code Archaeology: Document every file, function, and code change discussed]\n- No codebase/files; this is a legal research and link-verification task.\n\n[Progress Assessment: What's done vs. pending with specific status]\n- Done:\n  - Identified core Acts/Regs for AFSL.\n  - Verified direct, working links to key Corporations Act sections:\n    - Part 7.6 (licensing/admin): s 911A, s 912A, s 913A, s 913B, s 914A, s 915A, s 915B, s 916A, s 916B, s 917B, s 920A, s 922A, s 926A.\n    - Part 7.1 (definitions): s 763A (financial product), s 766A (financial service), s 766B (financial product advice/personal/general), s 766C (dealing).\n  - Located entry points for Corporations Regulations and ASIC Act/Regulations.\n- Pending:\n  - Complete enumeration of Part 7.6 and adjacent relevant provisions (e.g., s 911B; any 912B–F; s 914B; s 915C; s 916C–F; Div 8 full set including s 920B ff.; full Subdiv registers obligations s 922B+).\n  - Identify and link the specific implementing Corporations Regulations (e.g., regs 7.1.x and 7.6.x such as 7.6.01, 7.6.02, 7.6.02AA, 7.6.04 etc.).\n  - Add relevant ASIC Act consumer/conduct provisions with direct links (e.g., s 12BAA, s 12DA, s 12DB, s 12DF).\n  - Deliver the curated legislation-only link pack.\n\n[Context Validation: Ensure all critical information for continuation is captured]\n- Central requirement: legislation-only, no case law.\n- Corpus focus: Corporations Act Part 7.6/Part 7.1, Corporations Regulations, and ASIC Act provisions.\n- Rationale for direct-link approach recorded (deprecated search endpoint).\n- Most recent verified sections listed with key takeaways to guide completion.\n\n[Recent Commands Analysis: Last agent commands executed, tool results (truncated if long), immediate pre-summarization state]\n- Recent agent commands: Multiple fetch_webpage calls to AustLII direct section URLs to verify headings and core content:\n  - s915A (Varying licences): Confirms ASIC may vary an AFSL to reflect name changes; must notify licensee; notes on fees and that licence conditions can be varied under s 914A.\n  - s915B (Immediate suspension or cancellation): Grounds and procedures for individuals, partnerships, bodies corporate, and trustees; includes levy and CSLR non-payment triggers; AFCA/CSLR links; mandatory cancellations in certain circumstances.\n  - s916A (How representatives are authorised): Licensee may authorise representatives by written notice; void if outside licence scope or contrary to banning/disqualification orders or s 921C(2); revocation mechanics.\n  - s916B (Sub-authorisations): When and how an authorised representative can sub-authorise individuals with licensee consent; record-keeping; limits; offences for improper authorisation.\n  - s917B (Responsibility if representative of only one licensee): Licensee responsibility to clients for representative’s conduct where rep acts for only one licensee.\n  - s920A (ASIC’s power to make a banning order): Extensive grounds including 912A non-compliance, not fit and proper, training/competency deficiencies, involvement/likely involvement in contraventions, AFCA/CSLR links; hearing rights and special procedures.\n  - s922A (Registers relating to financial services): ASIC must maintain registers (licensees, authorised reps, banning/disqualification orders, etc.); regulations may prescribe details.\n  - s926A (Exemptions and modifications by ASIC): ASIC may exempt/declare/modifiy provisions of Part 7.6 (excluding Div 4 & 8) for persons/products; conditions; legislative instrument status; Gazette/internet publication; prosecution burden of proof clause.\n  - s763A (Meaning of financial product): Defines through investment, risk management, or non-cash payments; subject to s 763E; includes common-kind clause; does not cease if transferred.\n  - s766A (Meaning of financial service): Lists services (advice, dealing, market making, operating schemes/CCIV, custodial/depository, crowd-funding, claims handling, super trustee services, prescribed conduct); reg-making power; clerk/cashier exception; overlap note.\n  - s766B (Meaning of financial product advice, personal advice and general advice): Defines advice; distinguishes personal vs general; exceptions (lawyers, tax agents), AML caveat, DDO-related non-advice scenarios, claims handling carveouts.\n  - s766C (Meaning of dealing): Activities constituting dealing; arranging; own-behalf exceptions; government/entity carve-outs; sub-underwriting; regulation-making powers.\n- Immediate pre-summarization state: Actively verifying definitional sections (s 766B, s 766C) after verifying core licensing/admin sections, consolidating a comprehensive legislation-only link set.\n- Triggering context: The cumulative, verbose section content from many fetches expanded context length; summarization triggered to compact while preserving essentials.\n\n</analysis>\n\n<summary>\n1. Conversation Overview:\n- Primary Objectives:\n  - “Australian Financial Services Licence, find legislation, no caselaw.”\n- Session Context:\n  - Mapped AFSL regime to Corporations Act Part 7.6 and key definitions in Part 7.1, with Corporations Regulations and ASIC Act conduct provisions. Initial scoped searches proved unreliable (one endpoint returned “Gone”), so the approach pivoted to direct deep-link verification of each section on AustLII. A growing set of verified, working links has been assembled.\n- User Intent Evolution:\n  - Stable throughout: provide legislation-only materials with working direct links; exclude case law.\n\n2. Technical Foundation:\n- Legislative Sources:\n  - Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) and Corporations Regulations 2001 (Cth).\n  - ASIC Act 2001 (Cth) and ASIC Regulations 2001 (Cth).\n- Retrieval/Verification Approach:\n  - Use AustLII direct section URLs; verify each page’s heading and core content; avoid search endpoints.\n- Architectural Pattern:\n  - Section-by-section curation: Part 7.6 licensing + Part 7.1 definitions first; then implementing Regulations; then ASIC Act provisions.\n- Environment Detail:\n  - Research workflow only; no code artifacts; live AustLII pages.\n\n3. Codebase Status:\n- Not applicable (no files/repo).\n- No functions/classes created or modified.\n\n4. Problem Resolution:\n- Issues Encountered:\n  - Scoped search URLs returned empty/unstable; one endpoint returned “Gone.”\n- Solutions Implemented:\n  - Shifted to direct AustLII section links, verifying each target section manually.\n- Debugging Context:\n  - Confirmed direct links are more reliable and precise on AustLII than general searches.\n- Lessons Learned:\n  - For AFSL legislative retrieval on AustLII, deep-link to sections to ensure stability and exclude case law.\n\n5. Progress Tracking:\n- Completed Tasks:\n  - Core framework identified; verified working links to key Corporations Act provisions:\n    - Part 7.6 licensing/admin: s 911A (need for AFSL), s 912A (general obligations), s 913A (applying), s 913B (when licence may be granted), s 914A (conditions), s 915A (varying licences), s 915B (immediate suspension/cancellation), s 916A (authorising reps), s 916B (sub-authorisations), s 917B (licensee responsibility), s 920A (banning orders), s 922A (registers), s 926A (ASIC exemptions/modifications).\n    - Part 7.1 definitions: s 763A (financial product), s 766A (financial service), s 766B (financial product advice/personal/general), s 766C (dealing).\n  - Located entry pages for Corporations Regulations and ASIC Act/Regulations.\n- Partially Complete Work:\n  - Full enumeration of Part 7.6 and adjacent provisions; selection of specific Corporations Regulations; selection of ASIC Act conduct provisions.\n- Validated Outcomes:\n  - Each verified page loads and matches expected headings/subsections; legislation-only links.\n\n6. Active Work State:\n- Current Focus:\n  - Finalizing a comprehensive legislation-only link pack for AFSL: Corporations Act Part 7.6, key Part 7.1 definitions, corresponding Corporations Regulations, and relevant ASIC Act provisions.\n- Recent Context:\n  - Just verified Part 7.6 reps/banning/registers/exemptions sections and Part 7.1 meanings of advice and dealing (ss 766B, 766C).\n- Working Code:\n  - Not applicable.\n- Immediate Context:\n  - Continue enumerating remaining Part 7.6 sections and map the precise implementing Regulations and ASIC Act sections to include.\n\n7.

ONLY stop if solved or genuinely blocked.\nTake action when possible; the user expects you to do useful work without unnecessary questions.\nAfter any parallel, read-only context gathering, give a concise progress update and what's next.\nAvoid repetition across turns: don't restate unchanged plans or sections (like the todo list) verbatim; provide delta updates or only the parts that changed.\nTool batches: You MUST preface each batch with a one-sentence why/what/outcome preamble.\nProgress cadence: After 3 to 5 tool calls, or when you create/edit > ~3 files in a burst, pause and post a compact checkpoint.\nRequirements coverage: Read the user's ask in full, extract each requirement into checklist items, and keep them visible. Do not omit a requirement. If something cannot be done with available tools, note why briefly and propose a viable alternative.\nWhen using the insert_edit_into_file tool, avoid repeating existing code, instead use a line comment with \\`...existing code...\\` to represent regions of unchanged code.\nSkip filler acknowledgements like “Sounds good” or “Okay, I will…”. Open with a purposeful one-liner about what you're doing next.\nWhen sharing setup or run steps, present terminal commands in fenced code blocks with the correct language tag. Keep commands copyable and on separate lines.\nAvoid definitive claims about the build or runtime setup unless verified from the provided context (or quick tool checks). If uncertain, state what's known from attachments and proceed with minimal steps you can adapt later.\nWhen you create or edit runnable code, run a test yourself to confirm it works; then share optional fenced commands for more advanced runs.\nFor non-trivial code generation, produce a complete, runnable solution: necessary source files, a tiny runner or test/benchmark harness, a minimal `README.md`, and updated dependency manifests (e.g., `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`). Offer quick \"try it\" commands and optional platform-specific speed-ups when relevant.\nYour goal is to act like a pair programmer: be friendly and helpful. If you can do more, do more. Be proactive with your solutions, think about what the user needs and what they want, and implement it proactively.\n<importantReminders>\nBefore starting a task, review and follow the guidance in <responseModeHints>, <engineeringMindsetHints>, and <requirementsUnderstanding>. ALWAYS start your response with a brief task receipt and a concise high-level plan for how you will proceed.\nDO NOT state your identity or model name unless the user explicitly asks you to. \nBreak down the request into clear, actionable steps and present them as a checklist at the beginning of your response before proceeding with implementation. This helps maintain visibility and ensures all requirements are addressed systematically.\nWhen referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n\n</importantReminders>\n\n</reminderInstructions>\n<userRequest>\nAustralian Financial Services Licence, find legislation, no caselaw\n</userRequest>\n"

Conversation Overview:\n- Primary Objectives:\n  - “Australian Financial Services Licence, find legislation, no caselaw.”\n- Session Context:\n  - Identified AFSL legislative framework (Corporations Act Part 7.6; definitions in Part 7.1; Corporations Regulations; ASIC Act). Tried database-scoped searches; when those were unreliable or endpoint returned “Gone,” shifted to direct section URLs and verified them. Compiling clean legislation-only links.\n- User Intent Evolution:\n  - Consistently focused on legislation-only materials for AFSL; no shift toward case law or commentary.\n\n2. Technical Foundation:\n- AustLII legislative databases:\n  - Commonwealth Consolidated Acts/Regulations used for sourcing statutes and regulations.\n- Search and retrieval approach:\n  - Initial scoped text searches; fallback to constructing search URLs; final approach: direct section URL verification due to an outdated search endpoint.\n- Architectural pattern:\n  - Verify by direct deep links to sections to ensure working URLs and exclude case law.\n- Environment detail:\n  - Pure research context with live legislative pages; no local codebase or runtime.\n\n3. Codebase Status:\n- No codebase involved; no files or functions were created or modified.\n- Work consisted of legal research and link verification only.\n\n4. Problem Resolution:\n- Issues Encountered:\n  - Scoped searches for composite AFSL queries returned empty results.\n  - A constructed search results URL returned “Gone” (deprecated endpoint).\n- Solutions Implemented:\n  - Switched to direct section pages of the Act/Regs and verified the URLs individually.\n- Debugging Context:\n  - Confirmed reliability of direct section URLs versus search result pages.\n- Lessons Learned:\n  - For AustLII, direct section links are more stable than certain search endpoints; verifying sections individually ensures robust results and adherence to “no case law.”\n\n5. Progress Tracking:\n- Completed Tasks:\n  - Confirmed databases for legislation only.\n  - Verified key Corporations Act sections relevant to AFSL:\n    - s 911A (Need for AFSL) – working link verified.\n    - s 912A (General obligations) – working link verified.\n    - s 913A (Applying for a licence) – working link verified.\n    - s 913B (When a licence may be granted) – working link verified.\n    - s 914A (Conditions on the licence) – working link verified.\n    - s 915B (Immediate suspension or cancellation) – working link verified.\n    - s 763A (Meaning of financial product) – working link verified.\n  - Located top-level legislation pages for:\n    - Corporations Regulations 2001 – accessible.\n    - ASIC Act 2001 – accessible.\n    - ASIC Regulations 2001 – accessible.\n- Partially Complete Work:\n  - Enumeration and linking of all additional Part 7.6 sections and relevant regs is pending.\n- Validated Outcomes:\n  - Direct legislation links (not case law) for core AFSL provisions work and load properly.\n\n6. Active Work State:\n- Current Focus:\n  - Finalizing a curated list of direct links for all pertinent AFSL-related sections and corresponding regulations; adding relevant ASIC Act conduct provisions.\n- Recent Context:\n  - Just verified s 763A (definitions) after verifying s 911A, 912A, 913A/B, 914A, 915B. Confirmed Acts/Regs entry points.\n- Working Code:\n  - Not applicable (research only).\n- Immediate Context:\n  - Preparing to compile and present a legislation-only link pack aligned with AFSL requirements.\n\n7. Recent Operations:\n- Last Agent Commands:\n  - Verified direct section pages for the Corporations Act: ss 911A, 912A, 913A, 913B, 914A, 915B; then verified s 763A.\n  - Prior: targeted title searches for Corporations Act/Regs, ASIC Act/Regs; attempted shareable search URLs; attempted to fetch a search results page that responded “Gone.”\n- Tool Results Summary:\n  - s 911A page: Loaded successfully; full section content and notes visible.\n  - s 912A page: Loaded successfully; obligations (efficiency, honesty, fairness, conflicts, resources, competence, training, AFCA, risk management, civil penalty).\n  - s 913A page: Loaded successfully; application requirements in prescribed form.\n  - s 913B page: Loaded successfully; grant/refusal criteria; fit and proper; hearings.\n  - s 914A page: Loaded successfully; licence conditions; APRA coordination; service specification.\n  - s 915B page: Loaded successfully; immediate suspension/cancellation across entity types; levy/CSLR/AFCA triggers.\n  - s 763A page: Loaded successfully; definition of “financial product.”\n  - Attempted shareable search URL: Returned “Gone” (endpoint no longer available).\n  - Initial composite searches within Acts/Regs: Returned empty results for the combined queries used.\n- Pre-Summary State:\n  - Verifying core definitions (s 763A) and preparing the final curated legislation-only list.\n- Operation Context:\n  - All actions aimed at delivering reliable, direct legislative links for AFSL without any case law.\n\n8. Continuation Plan:\n- Pending Task 1: Compile complete list of Corporations Act Part 7.6 sections (beyond those verified) with direct links. “Find legislation, no caselaw.”\n- Pending Task 2: Identify and link key Corporations Regulations provisions under Part 7.6 (e.g., 7.6.01, 7.6.02, 7.6.02AA, 7.6.04 and others tied to AFSL processes/conditions), using direct links verified to load.\n- Pending Task 3: Add relevant ASIC Act consumer conduct provisions (e.g., 12BAA, 12DA, 12DB, 12DF) with direct links.\n- Priority Information:\n  - Corporations Act Part 7.6 sections first; then the implementing regulations; then ASIC Act conduct provisions.\n- Next Action:\n  - “Provide a curated, legislation-only pack of working direct links for AFSL: Corporations Act Part 7.6, key definitions (Part 7.1), corresponding Corporations Regulations, and relevant ASIC Act sections.”\n\n</summary>"

Conversation Overview:\n- Primary Objectives:\n  - “Australian Financial Services Licence, find legislation, no caselaw.”\n- Session Context:\n  - Identified key legislative framework (Corporations Act Part 7.6; definitions in Part 7.1; Corporations Regulations; ASIC Act). Initial scoped searches proved unreliable; one search URL endpoint returned “Gone.” Switched to direct section URL verification and confirmed key sections load correctly. Now compiling a legislation-only link pack.\n- User Intent Evolution:\n  - Intent remained constant: legislation-only sources relevant to AFSL; exclude case law and commentary.\n\n2. Technical Foundation:\n- Legislative Sources:\n  - Commonwealth Consolidated Acts: Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), ASIC Act 2001 (Cth).\n  - Commonwealth Consolidated Regulations: Corporations Regulations 2001 (Cth), ASIC Regulations 2001 (Cth).\n- Retrieval Approach:\n  - Began with scoped searches; shifted to constructing search URLs; finalized on direct deep links to section pages due to deprecated/unstable search endpoints.\n- Implementation Rationale:\n  - Direct section links are stable, specific, and guarantee no case law contamination.\n- Environment Detail:\n  - Research-only workflow using live legislative pages; no local codebase.\n\n3. Codebase Status:\n- No code files or repositories involved.\n- No functions/classes created or modified.\n\n4. Problem Resolution:\n- Issues Encountered:\n  - Scoped searches returned empty for composite AFSL queries.\n  - A search results URL returned “Gone” (deprecated).\n- Solutions Implemented:\n  - Pivoted to direct section pages and verified each for accuracy and availability.\n- Debugging Context:\n  - Validated that direct section URLs are more reliable than certain search endpoints.\n- Lessons Learned:\n  - For legislation retrieval on AustLII, use direct section deep-links for stability and precision.\n\n5. Progress Tracking:\n- Completed Tasks:\n  - Confirmed legislation databases relevant to AFSL.\n  - Verified key Corporations Act sections:\n    - s 911A Need for an AFSL — working.\n    - s 912A General obligations — working.\n    - s 913A Applying for a licence — working.\n    - s 913B When a licence may be granted — working.\n    - s 914A Conditions on the licence — working.\n    - s 915B Immediate suspension or cancellation — working.\n    - s 763A Meaning of financial product — working.\n    - s 766A Meaning of financial service — working (most recent).\n  - Located top-level pages for Corporations Regulations and ASIC Act/Regulations.\n- Partially Complete Work:\n  - Full enumeration of all Part 7.6 sections and related regs is in progress.\n- Validated Outcomes:\n  - All verified links point to legislation only; each page loads and matches expected headings and subsections.\n\n6. Active Work State:\n- Current Focus:\n  - Compiling a comprehensive, ordered, legislation-only link set for AFSL: Corporations Act Part 7.6, key definitions in Part 7.1, Corporations Regulations provisions, and relevant ASIC Act sections.\n- Recent Context:\n  - Just verified s 766A (Meaning of financial service) after verifying s 763A and the core Part 7.6 sections listed above.\n- Working Code:\n  - Not applicable.\n- Immediate Context:\n  - Preparing to enumerate additional Part 7.6 sections and identify the precise Corporations Regulations and ASIC Act provisions to include.\n\n7. Recent Operations:\n- Last Agent Commands:\n  - Retrieved the Corporations Act 2001 s 766A page (Meaning of financial service) to verify the direct link and confirm content.\n  - Prior verifications: Direct section pages for ss 911A, 912A, 913A, 913B, 914A, 915B, and s 763A.\n  - Earlier attempts: Scoped legislative searches and constructing shareable search URLs; one such search page returned “Gone,” prompting the direct-link approach.\n- Tool Results Summary:\n  - s 766A page: Loaded successfully. Key elements:\n    - s 766A(1): Lists activities constituting provision of a financial service (advice, dealing, market making, operating a registered scheme/CCIV, custodial/depository, crowd-funding, claims handling, superannuation trustee services, and prescribed conduct).\n    - s 766A(2)–(5): Regulation-making powers, clerk/cashier exception, scheme operation clarification, and overlap provisions. Navigation confirmed placement in Part 7.1.\n  - Other section pages: All loaded and matched expected headings/subsections (details truncated).\n  - Search URL attempt: Returned “Gone.”\n- Pre-Summary State:\n  - Actively consolidating definitions (s 763A, s 766A) and preparing the comprehensive link pack; the accumulation of multiple detailed page fetches triggered the need to summarize.\n- Operation Context:\n  - These actions directly progress the user’s goal of a legislation-only AFSL resource list with working, reliable links.\n\n8. Continuation Plan:\n- Pending Task 1: Enumerate all remaining Corporations Act Part 7.6 sections relevant to AFSL and provide direct links (e.g., 911B; 912B–F as applicable; 914B; 915A/C; 916A+; 917B; 920A; 922A; 926A; etc.).\n- Pending Task 2: Identify and link key Corporations Regulations under Part 7.6 (e.g., regs 7.6.01, 7.6.02, 7.6.02AA, 7.6.04 and others referenced by the Act).\n- Pending Task 3: Add ASIC Act consumer conduct provisions with direct links (e.g., 12BAA, 12DA, 12DB, 12DF).\n- Priority Information:\n  - Prioritize Corporations Act Part 7.6; then implementing Regulations; then ASIC Act provisions.\n- Next Action:\n  - “Provide a curated, legislation-only pack of working direct links for AFSL: Corporations Act Part 7.6, key definitions (Part 7.1), corresponding Corporations Regulations, and relevant ASIC Act sections.”\n\n</summary>"

reg-making power; clerk/cashier exception; overlap note.\n  - s766B (Meaning of financial product advice, personal advice and general advice): Defines advice; distinguishes personal vs general; exceptions (lawyers, tax agents), AML caveat, DDO-related non-advice scenarios, claims handling carveouts.\n  - s766C (Meaning of dealing): Activities constituting dealing; arranging; own-behalf exceptions; government/entity carve-outs; sub-underwriting; regulation-making powers.\n- Immediate pre-summarization state: Actively verifying definitional sections (s 766B, s 766C) after verifying core licensing/admin sections, consolidating a comprehensive legislation-only link set.\n- Triggering context: The cumulative, verbose section content from many fetches expanded context length; summarization triggered to compact while preserving essentials.\n\n</analysis>\n\n<summary>\n1. Conversation Overview:\n- Primary Objectives:\n  - “Australian Financial Services Licence, find legislation, no caselaw.”\n- Session Context:\n  - Mapped AFSL regime to Corporations Act Part 7.6 and key definitions in Part 7.1, with Corporations Regulations and ASIC Act conduct provisions. Initial scoped searches proved unreliable (one endpoint returned “Gone”), so the approach pivoted to direct deep-link verification of each section on AustLII. A growing set of verified, working links has been assembled.\n- User Intent Evolution:\n  - Stable throughout: provide legislation-only materials with working direct links; exclude case law.\n\n2. Technical Foundation:\n- Legislative Sources:\n  - Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) and Corporations Regulations 2001 (Cth).\n  - ASIC Act 2001 (Cth) and ASIC Regulations 2001 (Cth).\n- Retrieval/Verification Approach:\n  - Use AustLII direct section URLs; verify each page’s heading and core content; avoid search endpoints.\n- Architectural Pattern:\n  - Section-by-section curation: Part 7.6 licensing + Part 7.1 definitions first; then implementing Regulations; then ASIC Act provisions.\n- Environment Detail:\n  - Research workflow only; no code artifacts; live AustLII pages.\n\n3. Codebase Status:\n- Not applicable (no files/repo).\n- No functions/classes created or modified.\n\n4. Problem Resolution:\n- Issues Encountered:\n  - Scoped search URLs returned empty/unstable; one endpoint returned “Gone.”\n- Solutions Implemented:\n  - Shifted to direct AustLII section links, verifying each target section manually.\n- Debugging Context:\n  - Confirmed direct links are more reliable and precise on AustLII than general searches.\n- Lessons Learned:\n  - For AFSL legislative retrieval on AustLII, deep-link to sections to ensure stability and exclude case law.\n\n5. Progress Tracking:\n- Completed Tasks:\n  - Core framework identified; verified working links to key Corporations Act provisions:\n    - Part 7.6 licensing/admin: s 911A (need for AFSL), s 912A (general obligations), s 913A (applying), s 913B (when licence may be granted), s 914A (conditions), s 915A (varying licences), s 915B (immediate suspension/cancellation), s 916A (authorising reps), s 916B (sub-authorisations), s 917B (licensee responsibility), s 920A (banning orders), s 922A (registers), s 926A (ASIC exemptions/modifications).\n    - Part 7.1 definitions: s 763A (financial product), s 766A (financial service), s 766B (financial product advice/personal/general), s 766C (dealing).\n  - Located entry pages for Corporations Regulations and ASIC Act/Regulations.\n- Partially Complete Work:\n  - Full enumeration of Part 7.6 and adjacent provisions; selection of specific Corporations Regulations; selection of ASIC Act conduct provisions.\n- Validated Outcomes:\n  - Each verified page loads and matches expected headings/subsections; legislation-only links.\n\n6. Active Work State:\n- Current Focus:\n  - Finalizing a comprehensive legislation-only link pack for AFSL: Corporations Act Part 7.6, key Part 7.1 definitions, corresponding Corporations Regulations, and relevant ASIC Act provisions.\n- Recent Context:\n  - Just verified Part 7.6 reps/banning/registers/exemptions sections and Part 7.1 meanings of advice and dealing (ss 766B, 766C).\n- Working Code:\n  - Not applicable.\n- Immediate Context:\n  - Continue enumerating remaining Part 7.6 sections and map the precise implementing Regulations and ASIC Act sections to include.\n\n7. Recent Operations:\n- Last Agent Commands:\n  - fetch_webpage to verify direct AustLII section pages:\n    - Corporations Act s915A: https://www.austlii.edu.au/.../ca2001172/s915a.html\n    - Corporations Act s915B: https://www.austlii.edu.au/.../ca2001172/s915b.html\n    - Corporations Act s916A: https://www.austlii.edu.au/.../ca2001172/s916a.html\n    - Corporations Act s916B: https://www.austlii.edu.au/.../ca2001172/s916b.html\n    - Corporations Act s917B: https://www.austlii.edu.au/.../ca2001172/s917b.html\n    - Corporations Act s920A: https://www.austlii.edu.au/.../ca2001172/s920a.html\n    - Corporations Act s922A: https://www.austlii.edu.au/.../ca2001172/s922a.html\n    - Corporations Act s926A: https://www.austlii.edu.au/.../ca2001172/s926a.html\n    - Corporations Act s763A: https://www.austlii.edu.au/.../ca2001172/s763a.html\n    - Corporations Act s766A: https://www.austlii.edu.au/.../ca2001172/s766a.html\n    - Corporations Act s766B: https://www.austlii.edu.au/.../ca2001172/s766b.html\n    - Corporations Act s766C: https://www.austlii.edu.au/.../ca2001172/s766c.html\n- Tool Results Summary:\n  - s915A: “Varying licences” — ASIC may vary AFSL to reflect name change upon proper lodgment; must notify licensee; notes on fees and link to s 914A for conditions.\n  - s915B: “Immediate suspension or cancellation” — Detailed grounds across licensee types; includes levy/CSLR non-payment triggers and AFCA/CSLR linkage; mandatory cancellations in specified scenarios.\n  - s916A: “How representatives are authorised” — Written authorisation; limits; void if outside scope or contrary to orders or s 921C(2); revocation by notice.\n  - s916B: “Sub-authorisations” — When authorised reps may sub-authorise individuals with licensee consent; record-keeping and offences for improper authorisations; revocation and notification duties.\n  - s917B: “Responsibility if representative of only one licensee” — Licensee responsible to the client for rep’s conduct when rep acts for only one licensee.\n  - s920A: “ASIC’s power to make a banning order” — Broad, enumerated grounds (912A breaches, fit and proper, competency, contraventions/likely contraventions, AFCA/CSLR events, insolvency, etc.); hearing rights and special APRA-coordination for RSE licensees.\n  - s922A: “Registers relating to financial services” — ASIC must maintain registers; regs prescribe details; includes licensees, authorised reps, banned/disqualified persons, etc.\n  - s926A: “Exemptions and modifications by ASIC” — ASIC can exempt/declare classes/persons/products regarding Part 7.6 (excl.
