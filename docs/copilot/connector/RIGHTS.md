# Data rights and attribution

Summary
- The connector assists discovery by returning only titles, links, and lightweight metadata. Users open the primary source on AustLII.
- Primary law (legislation and court judgments) is public domain in Australia. AustLII hosts access to these materials.
 - We rely on AustLIIâ€™s public Web Developers guidance for linking and search forms; no bulk content is copied.

Practices
- Respect robots.txt and reasonable request rates. Avoid invasive techniques (no bypassing, no login, no CAPTCHAs).
- Attribute: "Results via AustLII (austlii.edu.au)" where appropriate.
- If AustLII publishes updated guidance, comply promptly. If requested by the service owner, we can remove/disable the connector.
 - Do not use AustLII logos except as allowed by their guidance.

Notes
- Some linked pages may contain headnotes or editorial content with separate rights; the connector does not republish such content.
- If formal permission is obtained, attach the letter/email in this folder.
