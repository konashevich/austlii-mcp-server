# Olexi AI: Project Documentation (Definitive Edition)

**Version:** 3.0
**Date:** August 8, 2025

## 1. Project Goal

The primary goal of the Olexi AI project is to significantly lower the barrier to entry for legal research on the AustLII database. By creating an intelligent conversational interface, we aim to empower users to find and understand complex legal information using simple, natural language.

## 2. Core Concept

Olexi AI is a browser extension that integrates seamlessly with the AustLII website, providing a chat-based interface that acts as an expert research assistant. It interprets natural language queries, formulates and executes precise searches against the AustLII engine, and returns a synthesized, human-readable summary with direct citations and a link to the full search results.

## 3. The AustLII Technology Environment: An Experimental Deep Dive

Initial development has revealed that AustLII's search functionality is non-trivial to interact with programmatically. The system is a legacy CGI application with undocumented security measures. Our success is contingent on understanding and correctly mimicking the behavior of a real browser interacting with its web forms. The following findings were retrieved experimentally and are critical to the project's function.

### 3.1. The Endpoint: The `cgi-bin` Ground Truth

*   **Finding:** Despite the presence of modern-looking URLs like `/search/` on the site, extensive testing confirmed that this endpoint is a deliberate dead end for our purposes, returning a `410 Gone` HTTP status.
*   **Decision:** The one true, functional endpoint for all search queries is the legacy CGI script:
    `https://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/sinosrch.cgi`
*   **Rationale:** All successful manual search submissions from the site's own forms ultimately resolve to this endpoint. It is the only reliable entry point for programmatic searching.
*   **Current Status:** ✅ **VALIDATED** - This endpoint is confirmed working and integrated into production code.

### 3.2. Request Method & Security: Simulating a Real Browser

*   **Finding:** A simple `GET` request to a fully-formed `cgi-bin` URL fails when accessed directly (e.g., pasting into a browser or using a basic script). However, network inspection of a successful manual search confirmed the request method is indeed `GET`.
*   **The Tricky Issue:** This paradox is resolved by the server's use of HTTP header validation to block non-browser requests. The server expects requests to "prove" they originated from a legitimate user interaction on the website.
*   **Decision:** All `GET` requests sent by our scraper **must** include specific HTTP headers to mimic a real browser.
*   **Implementation:** The following headers are now hardcoded in `austlii_scraper.py`:
    1.  `User-Agent`: `"Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/138.0.0.0 Safari/537.36"`
    2.  `Referer`: `"https://www.austlii.edu.au/forms/search1.html"`
*   **Current Status:** ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** - Headers successfully bypass AustLII's anti-bot protection.

### 3.3. URL Parameter Encoding: The "Repeating Key" Logic

*   **Finding:** When filtering by multiple databases, the AustLII server does not accept a comma-separated list.
*   **The Tricky Issue:** The server expects the parameter key for the database filter (`mask_path`) to be repeated for each value.
*   **Decision:** Our Python code constructs the URL parameters as a *list of tuples* rather than a standard dictionary.
*   **Implementation:** The scraper now uses `params = [("query", query), ("method", "boolean"), ("meta", "/au")]` followed by `params.append(("mask_path", db_code))` for each database.
*   **Current Status:** ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** - Multi-database searches now work correctly.

### 3.4. HTML Structure & Parsing Strategy: A Non-Semantic Environment

*   **Finding:** The HTML of the search results page is not structured semantically. The desired content (the actual results) is mixed in with other UI elements like sorting tabs and navigation links.
*   **The Tricky Issue:** A naive parser that simply looks for the first list on the page (`<ul>`) will incorrectly scrape the sorting tabs ("By Relevance", "By Database", etc.) instead of the actual legal documents.
*   **Decision:** The scraper employs a two-step parsing strategy.
*   **Implementation:** 
    1. First isolate the unique parent container: `soup.find('div', class_='card')`
    2. Then search within that container for: `results_container.find_all('li', class_='multi')`
*   **Current Status:** ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** - Parser accurately extracts legal document results while avoiding UI elements.

### 3.5. Database Code Architecture Discovery

*   **Finding:** AustLII uses a hierarchical database code system following the pattern `au/[type]/[jurisdiction]/[court_code]`
*   **Research Method:** Systematic analysis of the official AustLII databases page (https://www.austlii.edu.au/databases.html) revealed the complete database structure.
*   **Implementation:** The `database_map.py` has been expanded from 6 to 65+ databases covering:
    - Federal courts: `au/cases/cth/HCA` (High Court), `au/cases/cth/FCA` (Federal Court)
    - State Supreme Courts: `au/cases/nsw/NSWSC`, `au/cases/vic/VSC`, etc.
    - Specialized courts: Land & Environment Courts, Civil & Administrative Tribunals
    - Legislation: `au/legis/cth/consol_act` (Federal), `au/legis/nsw/consol_act` (NSW), etc.
*   **Current Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED** - Comprehensive database coverage across Australia's entire legal system.

### 3.6. JSON Serialization & AI Integration Challenges

*   **Finding:** Pydantic `HttpUrl` objects cannot be directly JSON serialized for AI processing.
*   **Issue:** The AI handler expected simple dictionaries but received complex Pydantic model objects.
*   **Solution:** Implemented explicit string conversion in `main.py`: `"url": str(item.url)` during result processing.
*   **Current Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED** - AI can now successfully process scraped results.

## 4. System Design and Architecture

The project is built on a robust, decoupled architecture consisting of a Python backend and a vanilla JavaScript browser extension. All communication between the backend and the LLM adheres to the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** for structure and reliability. The current implementation uses **Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash** model via the new `google-genai` SDK.

### 4.2. The Five-Phase Workflow

1.  **Capture (Extension):** The browser extension captures the user's prompt and sends it to the backend via POST to `/api/olexi-chat`.
2.  **Analyze & Strategize (Backend -> LLM Call #1):** The backend constructs an MCP-compliant request, including the user prompt and the complete database tools list (65+ databases). Gemini returns a structured JSON search plan with `query` and `databases` fields.
3.  **Execute & Scrape (Backend -> AustLII):** The backend executes the plan by building the correct URL for the `cgi-bin/sinosrch.cgi` endpoint with proper headers, fetching the HTML, and scraping it into a clean list of result objects using the two-stage parsing strategy.
4.  **Synthesize & Formulate (Backend -> LLM Call #2):** The backend constructs a second MCP request, passing the scraped results to Gemini. The LLM returns a final, human-readable Markdown summary with embedded citations.
5.  **Deliver (Backend -> Extension):** The backend returns a JSON object containing both the AI's summary and the dynamically constructed URL of the raw search results page.
