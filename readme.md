# Olexi AI — Law & Technology Research Server (MCP-native)

Version: 3.4  
Date: 13 August 2025

Olexi AI is a research project at the intersection of Law and Technology. It pairs a Chrome extension with a Python backend to orchestrate rigorous, transparent legal search on AustLII, then synthesises results in clear, British English. The backend is built as a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for tool execution, with planning and reasoning performed by the host (not the MCP server). This separation ensures auditability, security, and faithful sourcing.

Why MCP and host-led reasoning
- Separation of concerns: the MCP server provides tools (search, URL builder) only; the host agent plans queries and writes the summary. This prevents “black-box” scraping and keeps logic inspectable.
- Portability: any MCP-capable host (VS Code, browsers, services) can orchestrate the same tools.
- Safety and least-privilege: the tool-only server holds no AI keys; the host owns AI usage and policy.

What makes AustLII different (methodology and findings)
The AustLII search stack is a legacy CGI system with subtle constraints. We validated the following through careful experimentation:
- The true endpoint is the CGI script: https://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/sinosrch.cgi. “Modern” paths like /search/ return 410 and are unsuitable for programmatic queries.
- Requests must look like a real browser. At minimum include:
  - User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/138.0.0.0 Safari/537.36
  - Referer: https://www.austlii.edu.au/forms/search1.html
- Multiple database filters require repeating the key: use mask_path=… once per database; don’t comma-join.
- Parsing needs precision. Results live under div.card and each item is li.multi; naïve list scraping grabs UI tabs instead of cases.
- Database codes follow a stable taxonomy: au/[type]/[jurisdiction]/[court_code] (for example au/cases/cth/HCA, au/cases/nsw/NSWSC). See database_map.py for coverage.

Research framing: disciplined legal search, not fuzzy browsing
- Query planning enforces grouped ORs, avoids brittle date operators, and sanitises unsafe patterns before execution.
- Adaptive search modes: use method=auto for broad or vague prompts; prefer boolean (and sometimes titles-only) when scope is clear; switch modes automatically on empty previews.
- Host-side filters: optional year-from/to extraction from titles (e.g., [2024] …) and a configurable stop-list to reduce preview noise.
- Resilience: timeouts, retries, and back-off are environment-configurable; health probes are soft-gated to keep research flowing.

## System architecture (high level)

Extension (UI) → Host-led SSE session → MCP tool calls → AustLII → Preview → Host summary

- Browser extension: captures a natural-language prompt and streams a research session via Server-Sent Events (SSE).
- Host agent (server-side):
  1) Plans the AustLII query + database set; 2) invokes MCP tools; 3) applies filters/fallbacks; 4) produces a concise summary plus follow-up questions.
- MCP server (tool-only): search_austlii, search_with_progress, build_search_url.
  - Production (Cloud Run): MCP Streamable HTTP is served at the service root path "/" (no /mcp).
  - Local (combined app): the MCP transport may be mounted under "/mcp" when running the legacy host+MCP server.
- Scraper: performs the CGI request with required headers and parses div.card > li.multi.

## Endpoints
- GET `/status` — JSON status (AI availability, MCP presence, and AustLII health snapshot)
- SSE research session (host-led):
  - POST `/session/research` — streams planning → MCP search_with_progress → preview → summary
- MCP server (Streamable HTTP):
  - Production: served at the root path `/` (POST handshake at `/`).
  - Local legacy mode: mounted at `/mcp`.
  - Connect a compatible host to use the tools (list_databases, search_austlii, build_search_url)
- AustLII health:
  - GET `/austlii/health` — health + uptime summary (use `?live=true` to probe now)
  - POST `/austlii/health/probe` — immediate probe
  - GET `/austlii/uptime` — uptime windows and counters only

## Authentication and rate limits
- Development (local): API key in header `X-API-Key`, validated against EXTENSION_API_KEYS or client_api_keys.txt. Optional extension ID and origin checks.
- Production: extension keys only; strict origin/ID/UA checks; per-key daily caps and anti-sharing heuristics.

Environment variables (selected)
- EXTENSION_API_KEYS, EXTENSION_IDS, EXTENSION_ALLOWED_ORIGINS, EXTENSION_UA_PREFIX
- RATE_LIMIT_PER_DAY (default 50), MAX_DISTINCT_IPS (default 10)
- AUSTLII_POLL_INTERVAL, AUSTLII_HEALTH_TIMEOUT
- AUSTLII_TIMEOUT, AUSTLII_RETRIES, AUSTLII_BACKOFF
- PREVIEW_STOPLIST (optional, comma-separated terms)

## Setup (local)

Prerequisites: Python 3.12+

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
echo 'GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here' >> .env
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 3000 --env-file .env
```

Quick checks
```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:3000/status | jq
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:3000/austlii/health | jq
```

## MCP usage (tool-only)
- Production (recommended): point your MCP host at the Cloud Run service base URL; the MCP transport is at `/` (no path).
  - AU endpoint: https://olexi-mcp-root-au-691931843514.australia-southeast1.run.app/
- Local (legacy combined app): connect to `/mcp` if you run the host+MCP server together.
- Planning and summarisation remain in the host; this server never embeds an AI model.

## AustLII mechanics (implementation notes)
- CGI endpoint: `https://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/sinosrch.cgi`
- Headers: strict User-Agent and Referer to mimic genuine browser traffic
- Query parameters: `query`, `method` (boolean/auto/title), `meta` (`/au`); repeat `mask_path` per database
- Parser: find `div.card`, then `li.multi` items; ignore sorting/navigation chrome
- URL builder: repeat `mask_path` keys and percent-encode parameters

## Deployment
- Dockerfile and Cloud Run ready (container exposes `$PORT`, default 8080 in Cloud Run).
- Production region: deployed in Australia (australia-southeast1) for lower latency to Australian users and data locality.
  - Service URL (MCP at root): https://olexi-mcp-root-au-691931843514.australia-southeast1.run.app/
- See `docs/deploy_cloud_run.md` for build, push, and deploy steps, and suggested environment configuration.

## Ethics and respectful use
- Respect AustLII’s infrastructure: moderate timeouts and retries; avoid aggressive scraping; include a real User-Agent.
- Provide clear citations and a direct results URL for verification.
- Maintain an audit trail of health checks and security events for accountability.

## Acknowledgements
This project builds upon AustLII’s open access to legal materials and the MCP ecosystem for structured tool orchestration. We aim to advance practical research methods in Law & Technology while respecting the systems and communities that make such research possible.
