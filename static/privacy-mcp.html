  <h1>Privacy Policy — Olexi MCP Server</h1>
  <p><em>Effective: 14 August 2025</em></p>

  <h2>What we collect</h2>
  <p>
    The Olexi MCP Server itself does not intentionally collect or store personal data from end users.
    However, as part of normal operations on Google Cloud Run, connection metadata such as IP addresses
    and timestamps may be recorded in operational logs for security, rate limiting, and troubleshooting.
  </p>

  <h2>How logs are used</h2>
  <p>
    These logs are not transferred, sold, or used for commercial purposes. Retention and access are governed by
    Google Cloud logging settings and are intended solely for operational needs (e.g., diagnosing issues, abuse
    prevention). We strive to minimise data retention consistent with operational requirements.
  </p>

  <h2>Third‑party services</h2>
  <p>
    The MCP server may invoke third‑party services through tools (for example, querying AustLII at
    <a href="https://www.austlii.edu.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">austlii.edu.au</a>). Additionally, any
    AI agent or host that you choose to pair with this MCP server is under your control. We do not control and are not
    responsible for what such third‑party services or agents collect or how they process data. Their respective terms
    and privacy policies apply.
  </p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>
    For questions about this policy, please open an issue in the project repository.
